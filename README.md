### Project Description:
The purpose of this project was to modify an index.html file to 
create a movie application that displays the title, release date, 
plot, original language, poularity rating, and movie poster of 
any movie. This was achieved by using JQuery and AJAX methods to 
parse JSON data from a 3rd party server, using an API, an application 
programming interface.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson I learned about AJAX, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML 
    technology, which allows data to be loaded a server without a browser 
    page refresh
2. I also learned about JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation and XML, an 
    extension of the JavaScript language that is designed for human readability.
3. Finally, I was introduced to an API Key, an application programming interface,
    which is a set of instructions and standards used to access a Web-based software 
    application or web tool.
